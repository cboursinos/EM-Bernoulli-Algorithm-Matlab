Estimation Maximization Algorithm for Mixture Bernoulli distribution with Mnist Dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). 
The program is writen in matlab. 

In the main.m we have this parameters
K  = 1 // the K number
eterations = 100 //the number you want to run the test 
posflor = 0.000006 
D=784; 
SizeOfTrain = 100 //the number of train numbers you want to take
From those parameters you run all the tests you want. And those are the parameters from Bernoulli Distribution.
